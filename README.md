# Tigris

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

An open ended project that allows for the learning and expansion of existing fundamentals key to a wide variety of gameplay experiences.

The current focus is on generating a project using Unreal Engine and how Blueprints will manage to cohese with CPP. The goal is to learn the fundamentals of the Engine, Editor as well as the visual scripting within UE4. By the final leg of the project things should hopefully be refactored into as much CPP based functionality as possible/comfortable. Obviously blueprints have their performance concerns when not nativized and not everyone wants to use blueprints for everything, but just as obvious: not everyone wants to do everything in CPP. The key is to finding a happy balance between the two.
